A system and a corresponding simulator capable of handling an arbitrary number of particles under
gravitational forces, connected by springs. Also includes user interactivity.

***NOTE***: There is no code posted yet since I'm waiting to receive permission from professor of the course to post full code, but this was done with C++, OpenGL, Tcl/Tk, all in VS Studio.
